## 3. Unified Class & Schedule System

### 3.1 Problem Statement
Traditional class management systems require users to:
1. Create class types (e.g., "Yoga", "Pilates")
2. Create schedules (e.g., "Monday 9 AM Yoga")
3. Create individual class instances
4. Manage bookings separately

This creates unnecessary complexity for solo teachers who want to start quickly.

### 3.2 Solution: Unified Approach
Combine all class-related functionality into a single, intuitive system where:
- **One Class Entry** = Complete class definition with scheduling
- **Integrated Scheduling** = Built into class creation
- **Direct Booking** = Students book directly from class listings
- **Flexible Recurring** = Support for both recurring and one-off classes

### 3.3 Class Schema Design
```typescript
interface ClassDocument {
  type: 'class'
  name: string                    // "Morning Yoga", "Evening Pilates"
  description: string             // Class description
  location_id: string            // Where it's held
  day_of_week: number            // 0-6 (Sunday-Saturday)
  start_time: string             // "09:00"
  end_time: string               // "10:00"
  max_students: number           // Capacity
  price: number                  // Price per class
  credits_required: number       // Credits needed to book
  active: boolean                // Is this class available
  recurring: boolean             // Is this a recurring class
  start_date?: string            // When recurring class starts
  end_date?: string              // When recurring class ends (optional)
}
```

### 3.4 User Workflow
1. **Create Class** â†’ Teacher creates "Morning Yoga" class
2. **Set Schedule** â†’ Every Monday 9:00-10:00 at Main Studio
3. **Set Pricing** â†’ $15 per class, 1 credit required
4. **Set Capacity** â†’ Max 12 students
5. **Publish** â†’ Class is immediately available for booking
